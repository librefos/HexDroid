    Adaptive icon foreground — wraps the mipmap bitmap so the drawable-v24
    foreground slot always resolves to the real HexDroid artwork.
    The adaptive icon XMLs in mipmap-anydpi-v26 already point at
    @mipmap/ic_launcher_foreground (the .webp), so this XML is only
    reached by tools / previews that look for a drawable; having it
    reference the same bitmap keeps everything consistent.
