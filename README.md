## Configuration

- Client certificate for EXTERNAL auth
- Auto-connect and auto-join settings
- Character encoding
- Post-connect commands

### Global Settings

- Notification preferences
- Highlight words
- Logging options
- DCC configuration

---

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- Verify the server hostname and port are correct
- Most TLS servers use port 6697; plaintext uses 6667
- Check that TLS is enabled/disabled as required by the server
- For SASL errors, verify your credentials and that the server supports your chosen mechanism

### Certificate Errors

If connecting to a server with a self-signed certificate, enable "Allow invalid certificates" in network settings. Note: this disables protection against man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Background Disconnections

Some Android devices aggressively restrict background apps. To maintain connections:

1. Disable battery optimisation for HexDroid
2. Ensure the persistent notification is visible
3. Consider locking the app in the recent apps list

See [dontkillmyapp.com](https://dontkillmyapp.com/) for device-specific instructions.

### Garbled Text

If text appears garbled, the server may use a non-UTF-8 encoding. Go to network settings and select the appropriate encoding.
